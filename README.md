# ML2023_Project

This is a course project for Aalto-university course CS-C3240 - Machine Learning D that is run in Autumn of 2023.

Helsinki weather data has been downloaded from [Ilmatieteen laitos open data](https://www.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/avoin-data) and the Korkeasaari visitor statistics in `/Korkeasaari/` folder have been downloaded from [Helsingi region infoshare - Korkeasaaren Kävijämäärät](https://hri.fi/data/fi/dataset/korkeasaaren-kavijamaarat).

The dataset `korkeasaari_dataset.csv` has been produced using `dataset.ipynb`. This is the dataset that is used in the project.
